# Caulculator 

As part of the curriculum for The Odin Project, I created a calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Some items to note:
- I created functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- I used an array to store the operators and operands as a user selected them.
- I added keyboard support.
